# VidEdit

VidEdit (which obviously stands for Video Editing) is a Python library to edit videos. Thanks to it you can manipulate videos and/or audios with actions such as cut, loop, or concatenate.

VidEdit is based on FFmpeg which means it has to be installed on your machine before using VidEdit.
